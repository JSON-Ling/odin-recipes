        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>I gotta be honest, this isn't really a full-on recipe. It's definitely not traditional either, since there won't be any pancetta.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>Some bacon, you can go for pancetta too if you're feeling traditional</li>
            <li>Pasta, any type really but spaghetti is a good default pick</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper (to taste)</li>
            <li>Grated parmesan cheese, like a bag of it from the store</li>
            <li>Cooked pasta water, keep some when you're done boiling the pasta</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Cut up your pork into smaller bits, easier to cook.</li>
            <li>Whisk up your eggs and parmesan cheese in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Fill up a pot of water and add a bit of salt, bring pot to a boil</li>
            <li>Add your pasta to the boiling pot and let it cook until al dente</li>
            <li>Keep about half a cup of pasta water, then drain the rest.</li>
            <li>Start with a cold pan, add bacon and let the fat render out as it fries.</li>
            <li>Toss in the pasta into the pan and mix well with the oil.</li>
            <li>Turn off the heat and throw in the egg mix along with a bit of the pasta water, mix quickly for 1 minute otherwise the eggs will actually start to cook.</li>
            <li>Transfer to plates, add salt and pepper to taste then serve.</li>
        </ol>
