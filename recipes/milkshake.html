        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Pretty simple and straight-forward recipe with a lot of leeway in what you can throw in. You only really need like three things, and a blender, to make a simple milkshake.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Milk, any kind is fine but the default for me would be whole milk</li>
            <li>Ice-cream, any kind but some all-time picks would be vanilla, strawberry or chocolate</li>
            <li>A blender</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Add around 5 scoops of your preferred ice-cream into your blender.</li>
            <li>Add a small splash of milk.</li>
            <li>Blend the ingredients until it becomes a sort of firm liquid, not too watery. If it's still too hard like ice-cream, you can add a bit of milk. If it's too watery, add more ice-cream. Blend it again until you get the texture you want.</li>
            <li>For best effect, pour the milkshake into a cooled glass and serve with a straw.</li>
        </ol>
